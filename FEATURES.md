# 📦 Feature Specification: Claude Code CLI (LangChain-based)

## 🧭 Summary

This tool is a **CLI-based conversational code assistant**, similar to Anthropic's Claude Code. It allows users to interact with codebases through natural language using a terminal interface, powered by LangChain and pluggable LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT-4, Mistral, local LLMs via Ollama).

---

## 1. 🔌 **Modular LLM Backend**

### ✅ Must Have

* Support for pluggable LLMs via LangChain wrappers:

  * `ChatOpenAI`, `ChatAnthropic`, `ChatFireworks`, `ChatOllama`, `ChatTogether`, etc.
* CLI flag to choose model or set via `config.yaml` / `.env`:

  ```bash
  claude-cli --model claude-3-sonnet
  ```
* Ability to pass API keys via env vars or config file:

  * `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Auto-discovery of supported models.
* Dynamic model switching mid-session.

---

## 2. 🧑‍💻 **CLI Interface with Rich Interaction**

### ✅ Must Have

* REPL-style interface (like Claude's code CLI):

  ```bash
  > What's wrong with this function in utils.py?
  > Please rename all test functions to follow `test_...` format.
  ```
* Multi-line inputs with `:` or `shift+enter`.
* Colored syntax highlighting for code responses (via `rich` or `pygments`).
* History and up-arrow navigation (like a shell).

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Markdown rendering in terminal (using `rich.markdown`).
* `!command` shell passthroughs (e.g., `!git diff`, `!ls`).

---

## 3. 📁 **Project Context Awareness**

### ✅ Must Have

* Load project context from current working directory:

  * Automatically scan for `main.py`, `src/`, `tests/`, etc.
  * Load up to `N` files for context, based on:

    * User prompt
    * Recency
    * File size
* Ability to manually include/exclude files:

  ```bash
  claude-cli --include src/core.py tests/test_api.py
  ```
* File summarization/embedding to handle large contexts.

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Context cache with change detection (e.g., checksum-based).
* Semantic file selection (e.g., “include all model classes” using a vector DB).

---

## 4. ✍️ **Natural Language Code Editing**

### ✅ Must Have

* User can issue requests like:

  * “Refactor this file for readability.”
  * “Add logging to the error paths.”
  * “Replace print with logging.”
* Modify files in place (`--apply`) or preview diffs (`--dry-run`):

  ```bash
  claude-cli "Remove unused imports from all files" --dry-run
  ```
* Show diffs with colorized output:

  * Green: Added
  * Red: Removed
  * Yellow: Modified

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Interactive confirmation per file before applying changes.
* Undo last change (git-based or temp file-based).

---

## 5. 🧠 **Conversation Memory & History**

### ✅ Must Have

* In-memory session history (LangChain `ConversationBufferMemory`).
* File-level memory: Remember recent changes or summaries.
* Save/load sessions:

  ```bash
  claude-cli --resume session1
  ```

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Long-term memory (e.g., using a vector store like FAISS or Chroma).
* Persistent memory across repo directories.

---

## 6. 🔧 **Tooling Integration (LangChain Tools)**

### ✅ Must Have

* Built-in LangChain tools for:

  * `PythonREPLTool` – Execute code snippets.
  * `TerminalTool` – Safe shell commands (disabled by default).
  * `FileSearchTool` – Semantic file search.
  * `GitTool` – View changes, blame, history.
* Enable/disable tools via config:

  ```yaml
  tools:
    - python
    - file_search
  ```

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Custom tools registration (`tools/my_custom_tool.py`).
* Secure sandboxing for Python tool execution.

---

## 7. 🧪 **Test-Aware Mode**

### ✅ Must Have

* Understands test structure (pytest, unittest).
* Prompts like:

  * “Write tests for `app/handler.py`.”
  * “Fix the failing test in `tests/test_math.py`.”
* Ability to auto-run tests and report output:

  ```bash
  claude-cli "Fix the test error" --run-tests
  ```

---

## 8. 🗂️ **Multi-File & Refactoring Support**

### ✅ Must Have

* Refactor across files:

  * Rename a function across all references.
  * Split a file into modules.
* Supports batch edits and previews.

---

## 9. 🔄 **LLM Feedback Loop**

### ✅ Must Have

* Automatically feed back model outputs for verification:

  * After applying changes, run `pylint` or `pytest`, feed back logs:

    ```bash
    claude-cli "Fix the import errors" --feedback lint
    ```

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Chain of thoughts trace mode (visible reasoning steps).
* Code execution + correction loop (with optional sandbox).

---

## 10. ⚙️ **Config & Dev Experience**

### ✅ Must Have

* `.claudecli.yaml` or `.claudecli/config.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  model: gpt-4
  context_files:
    max_tokens: 4000
    strategy: smart-greedy
  tools:
    enabled: [python, git]
  ```

* Logging, debug mode, and analytics toggle:

  ```bash
  claude-cli --debug
  ```

### 💡 Nice to Have

* Plugin system for 3rd-party LangChain tools.
* Hot reload of config.

---

## 🔐 11. Security Considerations

* No unguarded shell execution by default.
* Prompt safety checks (e.g., no "delete all files").
* File edit confirmation.
